# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# - Keeps RDS and MSK SGs isolated and only opens them to ECS service traffic.
# - Uses SGâ†’SG references instead of 0.0.0.0/0, applying the principle of least privilege.
# - Keeps bootstrap responsible for resource ownership (MSK, RDS SGs) while env attaches the rules.
